DB_USER=your_username  
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432

# Django Settings
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
```

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL 12+ (optional, can use SQLite for development)
- Git

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd jobApp
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Environment configuration**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your database credentials
   ```

5. **Database setup**
   ```bash
   # Create database migrations
   python manage.py makemigrations accounts
   python manage.py makemigrations companies  
   python manage.py makemigrations seekers
   python manage.py makemigrations jobs
   
   # Apply migrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create initial data**
   ```bash
   python manage.py shell
   ```
   ```python
   # In Django shell - create business streams
   from apps.companies.models import BusinessStream
   BusinessStream.objects.create(business_stream_name='Technology')
   BusinessStream.objects.create(business_stream_name='Healthcare')
   BusinessStream.objects.create(business_stream_name='Finance')
   
   # Create job types
   from apps.jobs.models import JobType
   JobType.objects.create(job_type_name='Full-time', description='Full-time employment')
   JobType.objects.create(job_type_name='Part-time', description='Part-time employment')
   JobType.objects.create(job_type_name='Contract', description='Contract work')
   JobType.objects.create(job_type_name='Freelance', description='Freelance work')
   ```

7. **Create superuser (optional)**

   ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/`

## Testing

### Using curl
```bash
# Test registration
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/accounts/register/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "testpass123", "user_type": "job_seeker"}'

# Test login
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/accounts/login/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "testpass123"}'

# Get job posts
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/jobs/job-posts/ \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>"
```

### Using Postman
1. Import the API endpoints into Postman
2. Set up Basic Authentication with user credentials
3. Test CRUD operations on different endpoints

## Deployment

### Production Considerations
- Set `DEBUG=False` in settings
- Use strong `SECRET_KEY`
- Configure proper `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
- Set up proper database with connection pooling
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Set up proper logging
- Configure static file serving
- Use HTTPS in production
